      <p>Yesterday Brian sent me a link to a little something they had worked on. It was a script that added a role attribute to all HTML elements with an exposed ARIA role. <q>But why?</q> you might ask. To feed our browser rendering engine overlords of course. No, to make it possible to use a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-selectors">CSS attribute selector</a> to select elements based on how they‚Äôre exposed. Brian goes into detail in their post <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/Reflecting-On-Roles.html">Reflecting on Roles</a>.</p>

      <p>I really like this idea because it would make writing CSS a lot easier and at the same time more meaningful. Last year I wrote a little bit about styling based on meaning in <a href="https://s.codepen.io/Michiel/debug/zvebZO/jVkpoggvLOoA">Cool Semantic Styles</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="ariarules">ARIA rules</h2>

      <p>ARIA does rule, but that‚Äôs not what I mean. ARIA has some rules that you should adhere to when you use it. Under <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#rules-wd">Web developer requirements for use of ARIA in HTML</a> it says (emphasis mine):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Web developers <strong>may use the ARIA role</strong> and aria-* attributes on HTML elements, in accordance with the requirements described in [wai-aria-1.1], <strong>except where these</strong> conflict with the strong native semantics or <strong>are equal to the implicit ARIA semantics of a given HTML element</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Brian‚Äôs current script breaks this rule for all the things. Which isn‚Äôt really a problem; <a href="https://twitter.com/briankardell/status/855825119876349953">adding a role that has the same value as the implicit role doesn‚Äôt actually break anything</a>. The reason it‚Äôs a rule is to discourage authors to manually add them when it‚Äôs not necessary to do so‚Äîwhich could go wrong and then actually break things.</p>
      <p>I would love to see something like this come of the ground as it would make styling so much easier. Brian already mentioned that a new pseudo-class might be a better solution.</p>

      <h2 id="pseudoclass">Pseudo-class</h2>

      <p>Brian wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Note, the syntax there is debatable - practically speaking it would probably make more sense to use a pseudo-class like :role(heading) for this purpose.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>That looks pretty neat. Imagine being able to write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>:role(button) {
‚Ä¶
}

:role(button):matches(:hover, :focus) {
‚Ä¶
}
</code></pre>

      <p>That would be downright awesome! It would select all the elements that are exposed as buttons‚Äîwhether it be <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a href="#rofl-not-a-real-button" role="button"&gt;</code> and style them, no more adding a <code>btn</code> class to all your divs that aren‚Äôt really buttons. In all seriousness, this would both make writing CSS easier and make people more aware of accessibility (or at the very least aware of these things called element roles).</p>

      <p>The reason a pseudo-class would work better than an attribute-selector, is, as Brian says: <q>I mean... a pseudo-class only because it isn't really an attr, it's a property</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="whataretheserolesanyway">What are these roles anyway?</h2>

      <p>Hmm, kinda skipped over that. Right, so an element‚Äôs role defines what kind of thing the element is. For example: the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>-element has an <i>implicit</i> role of <code>navigation</code>. This tells a browser that the thing, the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>-element, is in fact a navigation section. Which in turn means that a browser can attach certain behaviour to it. A browser could implement a keyboard shortcut that looped through all the navigation elements on the page‚Äîwhich would be very helpful.</p>

      <p>That‚Äôs already pretty cool, but it gets better (and more important)! Using a computer is pretty hard. Just look at how detailed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWFmtJSctNc">the 1984 Macintosh manual</a> was. We take ease of use for granted sometimes because we work with computers everyday and most things look pretty obvious to us.</p>

      <p>That‚Äôs the thing though, not everyone can see, computers for example. This is where the role really shines; the accessibility tree exposes the role property of an element in a way that the computer can understand. This information can be used for loads of things: telling a screen reader user that they can activate a button or checkbox via a key combinations, telling a printer not to print the <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> elements, or make it possible for CSS to select elements based on their role and style them (if only <span role="img" aria-label="grimacing face">üò¨</span>).</p>

      <p>If you want to learn more about roles, the accessibility tree, and how these communicate with other systems on a computer I highly recommend you read the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/aom/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md">Accessibility Object Model (AOM) explainer</a>. AOM isn‚Äôt implemented yet, but the explainer does a great job of explaining how it all works.</p>

      <h2 id="okaynowwhat">Okay, now what?</h2>

      <p>Good question. Brian told me that this isn‚Äôt the first time something like this has been proposed. Which totally isn‚Äôt a recurring theme when it comes to web things. Nope, not at all.</p>

      <p>Anyway, it would be good to explore this more and get more people in on it. First of all, the way in which this works needs to change a bit as to not ‚Äúbreak‚Äù ARIA‚Äôs rules.</p>

      <h2 id="backtoclasseseh">Back to classes, eh?</h2>

      <p>Perhaps, it‚Äôs what they were originally meant for anyway [citation needed]. I don‚Äôt see why Brian‚Äôs script couldn‚Äôt add a <code>button</code> or <code>menuitem</code> class to their corresponding elements (which have those roles).</p>

      <p>That, er, sounds kinda like what Bootstrap does with its <code>btn</code> class and so forth. But whatever, the thing is that you would get the actual exposed role for things as a class that you can use to style.</p>

      <h2 id="somaybenotclassesthen">So maybe not classes then</h2>

      <p>Ideally, to help this get a bit more traction, we would turn this into a plugin for something like <a href="http://postcss.org">PostCSS</a>. I already <a href="https://twitter.com/MichielBijl/status/857037610446987264">asked Jonathan Neal</a> if they‚Äôd be interested. To which they said they are! <del>I‚Äôll update this page when they‚Äôre finished :D.</del> <a href="https://codepen.io/jonneal/pen/gWLKbY?editors=1100">Jonathan has already made an implementation that works</a> <span role="img" aria-label="Sparkling star">üåü</span>.</p>

      <p>What this does is turn something like <code>:role(heading)</code> into all the corresponding CSS selectors, like so:</p>

<pre><code>h1:not([role]),
h2:not([role]),
h3:not([role]),
h4:not([role]),
h5:not([role]),
h6:not([role]),
[role="heading"] {
  ‚Ä¶
}</code></pre>

      <p>Jonathan said they wrote it as a proof of concept and that it‚Äôs not published into the PostCSS repo. Regardless, it shows you how easy it would be to style categories of elements, or rather, elements that share the same role.</p>

      <h2 id="okaythanksforuhmwhatexactly">Okay, thanks for, uhm, what exactly?</h2>

      <p>As of right now nothing much. I‚Äôd like to thank Brian for coming up with this, writing the script that does all the hard work, and reviewing this article. I‚Äôd also like to thank Jonathan for writing the PostCSS plugin to demonstrate how the pseudo-class selector could work. If you also think this is neat, please <a href="https://twitter.com/briankardell">tell Brian over on Twitter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_neal">tell Jonathan on Twitter</a> if you think the PostCSS plugin is something you‚Äôd be interested in using.</p>
